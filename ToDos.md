**Bug fixes and possible implementations that aren't complete ideas.** (Sub-categories of current idea go here.)
1. Link the 2 blocks set (UPPER and LOWER to break with each other.)
2. Lag spikes whenever placing multiple chairs (in the same chunk / nearby chunks [Need to narrow it down])
3. Change inventory tab to "Furniture" from "Chairs". 
3. Change inventory tab to "Lighting/Decor" from "Glass Lights". 

#Ideas
**Ideas for future modding:**
1. Functional Table (Using entity to place items on it. Like an ItemFrame)
2. Desk Lamp (Normal glass light but with VoxelShape)
